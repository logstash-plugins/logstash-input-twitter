## 3.0.3
  - Add protection for the (Java) Event when adding Twitter gem objects to the event in values,
    fixes #40.
  - add a specific rescue clause for any exceptions raised during event generation - these
    should not be handled by the general rescue in the run method because this rescue assumes
    a twitter gem upstream error and acts accordingly which is the wrong recovery action for an event generation failure
  - refactor tests and add new integration test that publishes a tweet with known content.

 - Dependency on logstash-core update to 2.0
